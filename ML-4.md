### Artificial Neural Networks
The term "Artificial Neural Network" is derived from Biological neural networks that develop the structure of a human brain.
Similar to the human brain that has neurons interconnected to one another, 
artificial neural networks also have neurons that are interconnected to one another in various layers of the networks. These neurons are known as nodes.

Input Layer:

As the name suggests, it accepts inputs in several different formats provided by the programmer.

Hidden Layer:

The hidden layer presents in-between input and output layers. It performs all the calculations to find hidden features and patterns.
Output Layer:

The input goes through a series of transformations using the hidden layer, which finally results in output that is conveyed using this layer.

The artificial neural network takes input and computes the weighted sum of the inputs and includes a bias. This computation is represented in the form of a transfer function.

It determines weighted total is passed as an input to an activation function to produce the output. Activation functions choose whether a node should fire or not. 
Only those who are fired make it to the output layer. There are distinctive activation functions available that can be applied upon the sort of task we are performing.
